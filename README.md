Gmvault is a user-frendly command-line tool. It tries to set all the necessary defaults to be self explanatory.

### Authentication

Gmvault allow users to use a XOAuth token or your gmail login password. The XOAuth authentication is the recommended way to access your account. 
This method is activated by default. After the first authentication for a given account, the XOAuth token is stored in $HOME/.gmvault and will be used for subsequent authentications. 

The following example uses XOAuth to access foo.bar@gmail.com
$>gmvault sync foo.bar@gmail.com

With the --passwd option, you can use your gmail login and password for a quick test or if you cannot use XOAuth. 
You will then enter an interactive session to enter your password. By default your password is not saved, but you can use the option to do it. Your password will be stored encrypted but please avoid using this option if possible.
